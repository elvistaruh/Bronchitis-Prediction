#  Bronchitis-Prediction

This repository contains a **machine learning model** and a **web application** that predicts whether a person may have bronchitis based on input health parameters. Users can interact with a simple web form, submit their data, and receive a prediction from the trained model.

##  Project Overview

Bronchitis-Prediction is a full-stack project combining:

✔ A **trained machine learning model** for bronchitis prediction  
✔ A **user-friendly web interface** built with Gradio  
✔ A real-time prediction system where users input parameters and receive a diagnosis prediction

This project aims to demonstrate the integration of ML models into accessible web apps for interactive use.

##  How It Works

1. A dataset of patient health data and bronchitis labels is used to train a classification model.  
2. The model learns to differentiate between bronchitis and non-bronchitis cases.  
3. A Gradio app lets users input relevant health parameters (e.g., symptoms, age, etc.).  
4. The model returns a prediction such as **"Bronchitis Likely"** or **"Bronchitis Unlikely."**
